📊 UIDAI Aadhaar Enrollment Analysis Dashboard

(UIDAI Data Hackathon Project – Result Pending)

🔹 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the UIDAI Data Hackathon with the objective of analyzing Aadhaar enrollment data and transforming it into meaningful, actionable insights using Power BI.

The dashboard helps understand:

Enrollment demand patterns

Operational pressure across states

Age-group and population-wise dominance

Time-based enrollment trends

⚠️ Note: Hackathon results are not announced yet. This repository showcases the complete analytical work and dashboard design.

🎯 Problem Statement

Aadhaar enrollment data is large, fragmented, and difficult to analyze at a national scale. There is no centralized, visual, decision-support system to:

Identify peak enrollment periods

Detect high-pressure regions

Understand demographic enrollment behavior

✅ Solution

A data-driven Power BI dashboard that:

Consolidates raw enrollment data

Applies ETL, data cleaning, and feature engineering

Visualizes insights through interactive dashboards

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Dashboard & visualization

Power Query – ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

DAX – KPI calculation & analytical measures

CSV Data – Government Open Data

Data Source: https://event.data.gov.in

📂 Dataset Details

Aadhaar enrollment records (CSV)

Time-based data (daily, monthly, yearly)

Geographic attributes (state, district)

Demographic attributes (age groups)

🔄 Data Preparation Workflow

Data ingestion using Power Query

Cleaning missing & duplicate values

Feature engineering:

Enrollment Intensity

Demand Pressure

Enrollment Momentum

Population Structure

Data validation before visualization

📈 Dashboard Highlights

Executive Summary

State-wise Enrollment Pressure Analysis

National Enrollment Trend Analysis

Population & Age-wise Enrollment Analysis

Policy Impact & Demand Zones

Weekday vs Weekend Enrollment Behavior

💡 Key Insights

Early-age group (0–5 years) dominates Aadhaar enrollment

Weekday enrollments are significantly higher than weekends

Most enrollments occur under low to moderate operational pressure

Seasonal and policy-driven enrollment spikes are clearly visible

🚀 Impact

This dashboard can support:

Government planning & policy evaluation

Resource allocation & staffing optimization

Early detection of high-pressure enrollment periods

🔮 Future Scope

Enrollment demand forecasting

High-pressure early warning system

Integration with census & population data

Predictive analytics for policy planning
